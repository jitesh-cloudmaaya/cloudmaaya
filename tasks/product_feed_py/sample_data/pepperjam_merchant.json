Revenue Share Payments.  (a)  During the term of this Agreement, we agree to pay you a revenue share (the \"Revenue Share\") equal to the applicable percentage of Net Revenue determined pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Affiliate Program overview\/description materials posted on the Network or otherwise provide by us.  We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Revenue Share schedule at any time without notice.  For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Revenue[A2] \" means all cash consideration (not including any portion of payment made through the redemption coupons or credits, or the purchase of gift certificates or gift cards) from merchandise sold in a transaction resulting directly from a Qualifying Link tracked by Pepperjam from your website to the Merchant Website in accordance with this Agreement, where the customer purchases such merchandise, less all taxes, shipping and handling charges, gift wrapping and other value-added service charges, returns and chargebacks.  You acknowledge and agree that we will not be obligated to pay any revenue share unless we actually ship the applicable order and receive full payment for such order. \r\n(b)  A transaction will only be deemed to be resulting directly from a Qualifying Link tracked by Pepperjam from your website to the Merchant Website if:\r\n               (i) such purchase is made during the time period set forth by us through the Network after the customer has initially entered our website through your tracked Qualifying Link (\"Revenue Share Time\"). After the Revenue Share Time, we will not pay referral fees on any products that are added to a customer's shopping cart after the customer has re-entered our website (other than through a Qualifying Link from your website), even if the customer previously followed a link from your website to our website.\r\n               (ii)  your tracked Qualifying Link is the most recent referral to the Merchant Site prior to such purchase among all marketing channels tracked by us or Pepperjam.  If we or Pepperjam are able to track a referral from another marketing channel (e.g. another affiliate, comparison shopping engine, paid search, banner advertisement or any other trackable marketing channel) that is more recent that your Qualifying Link, then the resulting purchase will be deemed to not be directly resulting from your tracked Qualifying Link.\r\n(iii) all determinations of Qualifying Links and whether a referral fee is payable will be made by us and Pepperjam and will be final and binding on you. \r\n(c)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, we will pay you the above-described Revenue Share on a monthly basis.  We will send, or cause to be sent, to you a check for the Revenue Share earned, less any taxes or other amounts that we may be required by law to withhold.  No interest will be paid on any such amount held by us.  If a Revenue Share payment is made hereunder and relates to merchandise that is later returned by the customer, the applicable Revenue Share will be deducted from the next applicable payment hereunder.  If any portion of such Revenue Share cannot be recovered through a deduction, we will invoice you for such amount and you agree to pay this amount within 30 days after receipt of such invoice.  Upon termination of this Agreement, we will send, or cause to be sent, to you, a check for the total amount of Revenue Share then owed to you as of the termination date.  The final Revenue Share payment may be withheld by us for a reasonable period of time to ensure that the correct amount is to be paid after making any adjustments that may be required, including, but not limited to, adjustments for returns. \r\n9.  Pepperjam Tracking.  (a)  We will track sales made to customers who purchase products using Qualified Links, that you will generate using Pepperjam's technology, from your website to our website, and reports summarizing this sales activity will be available to you also through the Network.  The form, content, and frequency of the reports are limited to those reports and capabilities available through the Network and may vary from time to time in our and Pepperjam's reasonable discretion.  We are not responsible for any changes that Pepperjam may make in their reporting format, timing, or types of reports available to the members of our Affiliate Program.  To permit accurate tracking, reporting and fee accrual, you must ensure that the links between your website and our website are properly formatted.

The Guidelines should be read together with our and Pepperjam\u0092s other policies.\r\n \r\nA.              Disclosure of \u0093Material Connections\u0094 Under FTC Endorsement Guides\r\n \r\nWe and Pepperjambelieve in full, fair and effective disclosures of \u0093material connections\u0094 relating to your relationship withus in accordance with Federal Trade Commission\u0092s Guides Concerning Endorsements and Testimonials (\u0093FTC Endorsement Guides\u0094), located at http:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/os\/2009\/10\/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf.  \r\n \r\nAs such, we require that all our affiliates and affiliate networks adhere to the FTC Endorsement Guides and disclose their \u0093material connections\u0094 when publishing content about us and our products, services and sites, including, but not limited to, on review\/rating sites, blogs, directories, and other websites, or via email, videos or collateral that purport to provide an endorsement or assessment in connection with the Network.  \r\nB.              How to disclose \u0093Material Connections\u0094\r\n\r\nIn order to comply with the FTC Endorsement Guides, your disclosure should be frequent, clear, conspicuous, and require no user action in accordance with the following guidelines:  \r\n1.     Frequent\r\nYour disclosure must appear on any page that has a review, recommendation, comment or article that promotes a product for which you receive any form of compensation.  Placing a single disclosure on your home page or a link to a disclosure in your footer is not sufficient.\r\n2.     Clear\r\nIt must be immediately clear at the outset that you receive compensation for your review.  This disclosure should be in language that is easy to understand and should not be in legalese.\r\n            For example, the following disclosure is an example of an acceptable disclosure:\r\nDisclosure: We are a review site that receives compensation from the companies whose products we review. We are independently owned and the opinions expressed here are our own.\r\n3.     Conspicuous\r\nThe disclosure must be conspicuous and easy to view on your site.  For the disclosure to be considered conspicuous, the font, color and size should be prominent and at least as and easily readable as the main text, including:\r\n\u0095       The disclosure should be appropriately titled, such as \u0093Disclosure: \u0094 to highlight its purpose.\r\n\u0095       At least as large or larger as the main text on the page. \r\n\u0095       In contrast with the background and the main text.\r\n\u0095       Darker than its background or its main text. \r\n \r\n4.     Require No User Action\r\nYour disclosure must be immediately visible to anyone who visits your site and reads a review, ranking or an endorsement.  A visitor should not be required to scroll, click or hover to read the disclosure. \r\n\u0095       Scrolling: Your disclosure should appear above the fold so that the visitor does not have to scroll down to see it.\r\n\u0095       Mousing over: Visitors should not have to mouse over your link to view your disclosure. \r\n\u0095       Clicking: Visitors should not have to click a link to view your disclosure.  Clickable links are only acceptable if the fact you are compensated is still obvious without clicking.  For example:\r\nAcceptable: Disclosure: We are compensated for our reviews.  Click here for details.\r\nUnacceptable: Click here to read our FTC disclosure. \r\nPlease take steps immediately to make sure that your site is in compliance with these guidelines.  \r\n\r\n","logo":"http:\/\/media.pepperjamnetwork.com\/programs\/logos\/6671","prohibited_states":"","mobile_tracking":"N\/A","category":[{"id":"7","name":"Accessories"},{"id":"19","name":"Clothing\/Apparel "}],"address1":"10345 W.

We\r\nreserve\r\nthe right to reject orders that do not comply with any requirements\r\nthat we\r\nperiodically may establish. We will be responsible for all aspects of\r\norder\r\nprocessing and fulfillment. Among other things, we will prepare order\r\nforms,\r\nprocess payments, cancellations, and returns, and handle customer\r\nservice. EBay\r\nwill track sales made to customers who purchase products using Special\r\nLinks\r\nfrom your Site to our Site and will be solely responsible for making\r\navailable\r\nto you reports summarizing this sales activity through the EBay\r\nNetwork.

We will pay you referral fees on certain\r\nproduct sales to customers as provided in Section 4. For a product sale\r\nto be\r\neligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must follow a Special\r\nLink from\r\nyour Site to our Site, select and purchase the product using our\r\nautomated\r\nordering system, accept delivery of the product at the shipping\r\ndestination,\r\nand remit full payment to us (\"Qualifying Purchase\"). We will not,\r\nhowever, pay referral or other fees on any products that are\r\nsubsequently\r\npurchased after the customer has reentered the Nordstrom.com Site other\r\nthan\r\nthrough a Special Link from your Site, even if the customer previously\r\nfollowed\r\na Special Link from your Site to the Nordstrom.com Site. Purchases of\r\nNordstrom\r\nGift Cards are not eligible to earn referral fees. You may not purchase\r\nproducts during sessions initiated through the Special Links on your\r\nSite for\r\nyour own use, resale, or commercial use of any kind. This includes\r\norders for\r\ncustomers or on behalf of customers or orders for products to be used\r\nby you or\r\nyour friends, relatives or associates in any manner. Such purchases may\r\nresult,\r\nin our sole discretion, in the withholding of referral fees or the\r\ntermination\r\nof this Agreement. <\/p>\r\n<p>4.\r\nReferral Fee Schedule. You agree and acknowledge that the\r\nreferral fees you earn pursuant to Section 3 will be in amounts\r\nestablished by\r\nus and posted on the EBay Site together with the application materials.\r\nThe\r\nReferral Fee Schedule is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.\r\nWe\r\nreserve the right to modify the Referral Fee Schedule at any time in\r\nour sole\r\ndiscretion upon prior notice to you. Referral fees shall be limited to\r\na\r\nmaximum of 5% per item unless otherwise provided in the Referral Fee\r\nSchedule.\r\nThe referral fees shall be calculated as a percentage of \"qualifying\r\nrevenues,\"\r\nwhich are revenues derived by us from Qualifying Purchases, excluding\r\nrevenues\r\nderived from and costs associated with shipping, handling,\r\ngift-wrapping,\r\ntaxes, service charges, credit card processing fees, bad debt and\r\npromotional\r\ndiscounts as advertised. <\/p>\r\n<p>5.\r\nReferral Fee Payment. We will pay referral fees on a\r\nmonthly basis. Approximately 45 days following the end of each calendar\r\nmonth, EBay\r\nwill send you a check for the referral fees earned on net sales of\r\nproducts\r\nthat were shipped during that month, less any taxes that we are\r\nrequired by law\r\nto withhold. However, if the referral fees payable to you for any\r\ncalendar\r\nmonth are less than $25.00 , we will hold those referral fees until the\r\ntotal\r\namount due is at least $25.00 or until this Agreement is terminated. If\r\na\r\nproduct that generated a referral fee is returned by the customer, we\r\nwill\r\ndeduct the corresponding referral fee from your next monthly payment.\r\nIf there\r\nis no subsequent payment, we will send you a bill for the returned\r\nproduct\r\nreferral fee. <\/p>\r\n<p>6.\r\nPolicies and Pricing. Customers who buy products through\r\nthis Program will be deemed to be our customers. Accordingly, all\r\nNordstrom,\r\nInc. rules, policies and operating procedures concerning customer\r\norders,\r\ncustomer service, and product sales will apply to those customers.
